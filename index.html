  <p>
    I'm a web developer in the San Francisco Bay Area.
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm one of those guys that just can't stop optimizing things. If you've ever heard of Soylent, I'm that kind of guy. Anything I'm interested in, anything at all; I'll just take it and start figuring out how to make it easier, more efficient, or more effective.
  </p>
  <p>
    I've worked with SQL, Ruby on Rails, Javascript, and Backbone.js in creating the projects listed below.
  </p>
  <p>
    As someone planning to build out many of my ideas, improving myself and refining my skills is the best possible course of action, and web development is my enabler.
  </p>
  <p>
    I am comfortable with using the full stack and am interested in learning more.
