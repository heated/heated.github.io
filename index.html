    I'm one of those guys that just can't stop optimizing things. If you've ever heard of Soylent, I'm that kind of guy. Anything I'm interested in, anything at all; I'll just take it and start figuring out how to make it easier, more efficient, or more effective.

  <p>
    I've worked with SQL, Ruby on Rails, Javascript, and Backbone.js in creating projects like OpenCommunicate, Snake, and Rails Lite.

    As someone planning to build out many of my ideas, improving myself and refining my skills is the best possible course of action, and web development is my enabler.

    I am currently interested in learning the full stack.
